<div align="center"> <h3>Advanced Geometry Export & Mapping Tools for Call of Duty Radiant</h3> Mesh2Map is a custom build of <strong>Blender 5.0.1</strong> designed for level designers working with <strong>Call of Duty Radiant</strong>.<br> It provides a modern workflow for creating, preparing, and exporting geometry directly into Radiant’s <strong>.map</strong> format, supported by a suite of tools built specifically for mapping, terrain work, prefabs, and

🔸 Geometry Export
- Export Blender meshes directly to **Radiant .map** format  
- Clean brush output for blockouts, clipping, terrain, and structural geometry  
- Fast iteration with Radiant‑safe geometry generation  

🔸 Mapping Tools
- **Model Library Window** with preview, rotation, and asset metadata  
- **Prefab Browser** for reusable structures and map components  
- **KVP Editor** for entity keys/values and scripting setup  
- **Brush & Entity Utilities** for preparing Radiant‑ready geometry  

🔸 Terrain Tools
- Erosion helpers for natural terrain shaping  
- Error detection and cleanup for Radiant compatibility  
- High‑detail mesh workflows adapted for map export  

🔸 UI & Workflow Enhancements
- New windows and panels built specifically for mappers  
- Streamlined layout for blockouts, terrain, and worldbuilding  
- Designed to feel native to Blender while extending its capabilities
